## About The Project

The Plant Disease Recognition System is an application designed to help farmers, gardeners, and agricultural enthusiasts identify plant diseases efficiently. By uploading an image of a plant leaf, the system utilizes a deep learning model to analyze it and detect potential diseases. Our goal is to provide a quick, accessible tool to help protect crops and ensure a healthier harvest.

This project addresses the need for early and accurate disease detection, which can significantly reduce crop loss and improve agricultural yield.
